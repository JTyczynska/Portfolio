# Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my Project Null! 👋

Project Null because I have no idea what I'm doing. Let me be brutally honest - two days ago I didn't know what is Terminal and how to open it. Today I created the GitHub profile and this is my first step towards building my IT and Cybersecurity toolkit. 
I'm currently taking the Google Cybersecurity Certificate on Coursera and I've been very kindly advised to build my Portfolio. As per today I managed to panic, loose interest, faith and life purpouse fourteen times. But hey! It is my day off work and there is something increadibly fascinating about learning new things.

So be it! With shy basics in networking and cybersecurity I decided to stuck with it. Just a bit longer to see what will happen. 

Below is the portfolio draft proposed by genAI. I will use it for now and work through my course. 

My goals are to:
- Track my growth in cybersecurity
- Share hands-on projects, scripts, and writeups
- Build a foundation for a future career in cybersecurity
